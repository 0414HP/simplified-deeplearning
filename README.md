# Simplified DeepLearning
Simplified implementations of some interesting works related to deep learning.

## SGD Comparison
Comparison of various SGD algorithms on logistic regression and MLP. The relation of these algorithms is shown in the following figure, please refer to [sgd-comparison](https://github.com/SwordYork/simplified-deeplearning/tree/master/sgd-comparison) for the details.
