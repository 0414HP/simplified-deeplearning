# Function Approximation
Use neural network to approximate functions. The code is based on [keras](https://keras.io/), please install relative packages.

## MLP
We can use MLP to approximate some nonlinear functions,  for example, the [love function](http://functionspace.com/topic/360/What-are-the-funniest-beautiful-graph-s-equations-), $x^2-(y-\sqrt[3]{x^2})^2$. This figure shows the learnt function.
